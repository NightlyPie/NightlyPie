  <br>🐧 I also use GNU/Linux. More specifically: <a href="https://debian.org/">Debian</a>.
  <br>🖥️ I'm currently learning Java, React, and C. Why not?
  <br>⌨️ I talk about random things in my blogs
  <br>💚 I like to watch anime, learn new things, code, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn">customizing</a> and gaming.
  <br>If you happen to find one of my Projects, don't expect my codes to be good and efficient.
